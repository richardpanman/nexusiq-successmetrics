## The Fine Print

- Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to iq-success-metrics
- DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in
- Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all, have fun creating and using this application and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
